**Technical Description**
The default mode of the lamp is the “sleeping state” that only responds to touch and morning light to change state. The morning light (or flashlight) asks the user permission to wake up. This is followed up with a response by turning the rotator knob of the potentiometer to rotate through options for selection and a button to confirm the selection. Soon after the process is set to initialization, the lamp shares a list of actions that it can perform. Again, using the rotator and selector buttons, the user can scroll through and witness different animation effects implemented for each item.
